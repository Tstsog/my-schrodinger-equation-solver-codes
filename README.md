## Introduction: 

A matlab code H_atom_DC_Stark_resonance.m computes the DC Stark resonance parameters
for the atomic hydrogen using pseudospectral method combined with a complex absorbing potential.

A matlab code H2plus_eig_values_for_sigma_states.m computes eigenenergies for sigma states for the H2+ ion using pseudospectral method.

## Requirement: 
Any version of Matlab software.

## Implementation details and running

Both H_atom_DC_Stark_resonance.m and H2plus_eig_values_for_sigma_states.m codes use a code legDC2.m, which computes the Legendre 
differentiation matrix with collocation at the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto nodes and corresponding weights.   
You may download them and run the codes directly.
